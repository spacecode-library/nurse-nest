          <h2 id="what-is-llc" className="!text-2xl md:!text-3xl pt-2">What is an LLC and Why Nurses Need One</h2>
          <p>
            A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure that combines the flexibility of a partnership with the liability protection of a corporation. For nurses, forming an LLC creates a legal separation between personal and business assets, protecting your home, savings, and other personal property from business-related lawsuits or debts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike sole proprietorships, where you and your business are legally the same entity, an LLC provides a protective barrier. This is particularly important in healthcare, where professional liability risks are inherent in patient care.

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold !text-lg">Liability Protection</h3>
          <p>The primary benefit of LLC formation is liability protection. If your nursing practice faces a lawsuit or incurs debt, your personal assets remain protected. Only business assets are at risk.</p>
          <h3 className="mt-6 font-semibold !text-lg">Tax Flexibility</h3>
          <p>LLCs offer tax advantages through pass-through taxation, meaning business profits and losses pass through to your personal tax return. You can also elect corporate tax treatment if beneficial.</p>
          <h3 className="mt-6 font-semibold !text-lg">Professional Credibility</h3>
          <p>Having <span className="bg-blue-100 px-2 rounded">LLC</span> after your business name enhances credibility with clients, insurance companies, and healthcare facilities. It demonstrates professionalism and commitment to your practice.</p>
          <h3 className="mt-6 font-semibold !text-lg">Business Banking Benefits</h3>
          <p>An LLC enables you to open business bank accounts, establish business credit, and clearly separate personal and business finances—essential for tax purposes and financial management.</p>

          <p className="mb-5">Forming an LLC is a significant step toward establishing a professional nursing practice with proper liability protection and tax benefits. While the process involves multiple steps and ongoing requirements, the protection and credibility an LLC provides make it worthwhile for most independent nurses.</p>

          <p>Whether you’re starting a home health practice, launching a nursing consultancy, or providing specialized care services, proper business structure is the foundation for long-term success.</p>
