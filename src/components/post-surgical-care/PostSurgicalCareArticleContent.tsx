        </h2>
        <p>
          Post-surgical care, or post-operative care, is the care a patient receives after a surgical procedure. The goal is to monitor for complications, manage pain and symptoms, and support the bodyâ€™s healing process. This care is critical in preventing infections and ensuring the best possible outcome.
