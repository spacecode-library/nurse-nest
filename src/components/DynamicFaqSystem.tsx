          question: "Why am I not getting nurse applicants?",

          question: "Can I interview multiple nurses?",

          question: "Can I hire a nurse directly after matching?",

        },
        {
          question: "Are background checks mandatory?",

        },
        {
          question: "Who accesses my health data?",
          answer: "Access is strictly limited to matched nurses and essential platform staff for care coordination. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with comprehensive audit trails maintained."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I share health information in messages?",
          answer: "No. Our platform prohibits sharing protected health information (PHI) through messaging to maintain HIPAA compliance. The messaging system is designed for communication during the hiring phase. For ongoing care coordination involving health information, please communicate directly with your nurse outside the platform."
        },

          question: "What's your data retention policy?",

          question: "How do invoice verifications work?",
          answer: "After your nurse logs hours, you review and verify them. Invoices are processed via Stripe and sent directly to the nurse. We retain a 10% platform fee for operations, support, and compliance."
        },
        {
          question: "How are shift hours calculated when they cross midnight?",
          answer: "Nurses can enter shifts that cross midnight as single entries. For example, 10:00 PM Monday to 6:00 AM Tuesday. The system automatically calculates total hours and properly allocates them across dates."
        },
        {
          question: "Why were my hours rounded to 15-minute increments?",
          answer: "Hour rounding follows federal guidelines for fair labor practices. Clock-in and clock-out times round to the nearest 15-minute interval, consistently applied and documented for transparency."
        },

          question: "Can I dispute verified hours?",

        },

          question: "What happens if a nurse cancels?",

        {
          question: "How do I use the dispute resolution center?",
          answer: "Upload supporting evidence (shift logs, screenshots) directly through your dashboard. Our team reviews disputes within 3 business days and provides resolution. You'll receive updates throughout the process."
        },
        {
          question: "What if I need to pause care temporarily?",
          answer: "You can pause active job postings without canceling. This maintains your position in the queue and allows you to resume when ready, rather than starting the matching process over."

        {
          question: "Why do nurses charge high hourly rates?",
          answer: "Our nurses are independent professionals who manage their own business operations. Their rates reflect clinical expertise, malpractice insurance, and the cost of self-employment. Higher rates typically attract more qualified applicants."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I negotiate nurse rates?",

        },
        {
          question: "What if a nurse doesn't show up?",
          answer: "No-shows are taken seriously. We'll immediately search for a replacement and may apply penalties to the nurse's account. You won't be charged for hours not worked, and we'll prioritize finding you a reliable substitute."
